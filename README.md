# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used in computer vision research. The model applies deep learning techniques to recognize 10 object categories, including airplanes, automobiles, animals, and household items.

Through data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation, the project achieves ~70% accuracy, demonstrating effective application of neural networks for image classification tasks.
